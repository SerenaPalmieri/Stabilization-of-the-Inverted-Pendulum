# Stabilization-of-the-Inverted-Pendulum
The project addresses the vertical stabilization of a pendulum connected to a bar that can only move horizontally.
A PID controller was used to control the bar.
For stabilizing the pendulum, various methods were employed: the Kalman filter and LQ control.
The final goal was to raise the pendulum to the high position when it started from the low position with zero velocity (swing up). Here, two different methods were also used: the Bang-Bang approach and the Lyapunov-based controller.
